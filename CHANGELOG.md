0.5 - Jan 12 2017

- Quick View : a new way to quickly get info (including the Nutriscore) about several products in a row, and easily add them to Open Food Facts if they don't exist. Thanks to @itchix
- Better search, from everywhere: Search now includes brand, weight, and images are better looking. Plus you can now search from anywhere in the app. @herau
- Better UX: the UX has materially improved thanks to @herau. It matches the web version. This is our first take at following the Material design spec. Espect even more refinements in the next release.
- Lighter: the APK is 2MB lighter. Yes lighter :-)
- Vectorization: most assets are now vector based, which means that they'll look a little crisper, whatever your screen resolution.
- Bug squashing: the app won't send the units if you don't have time to fill the weight.
- History export: the history is now exported in your Downloads folder, for easier access. Download folder, but it NEVER leaves your device. It's yours. You can keep scanning your Nutella jar collection :-)
